# Language Translation using LSTM

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing an LSTM-based model for translating English sentences into Hindi. It covers data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation, offering a step-by-step guide to building an effective language translation system.

## üöÄ  Features
- Sequence-to-sequence model using LSTMs
- Tokenization and text preprocessing
- Encoder-Decoder architecture
- Training on parallel corpus of English-Hindi sentences


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seq2Seq modeling

## Dataset
The dataset consists of English-Hindi sentence pairs. It undergoes preprocessing, including:
- Tokenization
- Padding sequences
- Converting text to numerical format (word embeddings)

## Model Architecture
The model follows a **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture**:
1. **Encoder**: An LSTM processes input English sentences, encoding them into a context vector.
2. **Decoder**: Another LSTM generates Hindi translations based on the context vector.
3. **Attention Mechanism (Optional)**: Helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide
üí° Note: It is highly recommended to use a CUDA-enabled GPU (such as NVIDIA GPUs) for faster training. If a GPU is not available, training can be done on a CPU, but it will be significantly slower
